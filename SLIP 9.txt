--> Not Answered.

Q2 Write a python program to implement Linear SVM.
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load a sample dataset (e.g., the iris dataset)
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Linear SVM model
svm_model = LinearSVC()

# Train the model on the training set
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = svm_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate and print the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
